## Objective
User can generate multiple sudoku's acordignto different difficulty level and can also get solutions to any sudoku problem. Here the term difficulty is synonymous with the number of tiles to fill. Higher the difficulty, more the number of empty tiles. 
## Accomplishments 
* Modelled the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem and implemented the backtracking search algorithm to solve it
* Implemented heuristics such as the Most Contrained Variable and the Least Constrained Value
* Implemented inference algorithms such as Forward Check

## Results
Using Django created a simple web interafce to interact with the Sudoku.
