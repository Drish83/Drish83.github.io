## Objective
Built a simple automatic irrigation system using Arduino UNO board. 

## Accomplishments 
* The system monitors the moisture content in the soil.
* In case, the moisture level in the soil drops below a certain level, the motor pump is turned on.
* The soil moisture sensor has two conductive probes. Basically, it measures the dielectric permittivity of the surrounding medium (dielectric constant=soilâ€™s ability to transmit electricity). 


## Results
Got selected for the State-level competition "Awishkar" to represent our college.
