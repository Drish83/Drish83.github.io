## Objective
In this work, we investigate the game of Gobang using multiple algorithms, including Mini-Max Tree Search with Alpha-Beta Pruning, Monte Carlo Tree Search, Genetic Algorithm, Deep Q-Network, and AlphaZero.

## Accomplishments 
* Implemented Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-beta pruning
* Implemented Genetic Algorithm
* Implemented progressive MCTS
* Trained and Implemented DQN-based agent 
* Trained and Implemented AlphaZero 
* Compared the Algorithms across Different Board Size and Training Iterations

## Results

We found that the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and Monte Carlo tree search worked well on smaller board sizes, while AlphaGoZero outperformed other algorithms after 3,000 epochs of training.
