## Accomplishments 
* Implemented a web scraping process to download the latest annual and financial reports when a company name is searched.
* Parsed the extracted information and fed it into a Large Language Model (LLM) for further processing.
* Set up a Langchain pipeline with multiple prompts that the LLM uses to extract leads from the gathered information.
* Structured the output in JSON format to ensure a well-organized layout.
* Utilized the pptx library to automatically generate a PowerPoint presentation from the JSON data, including key information on topics such as financial metrics, sustainability initiatives, and future plans, making the content easily accessible for the sales team.
* Integrated Yahoo Finanace API to retrieve additional company details.
## Results
